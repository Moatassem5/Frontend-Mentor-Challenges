## Features

- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The project designs are inside the `/design` folder, available in both mobile and desktop versions. The designs are in JPG static format, so I used my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Variable and static font files for the required fonts are also included.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.

## Deploying the project

I deployed the project using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
